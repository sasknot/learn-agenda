## Results

### What I learnt?

- Bootstraping with Vite + Vue 3
- Usage of TailwindCSS
- Vue 3 Composition API
- Better cookie/localStorage data store

### What I will try to do henceforth?

#### Use Vite + Vue 3
Best stack, ever! Vite is super fast.

#### Use Vue 3 Composition API
The Composition API seems very interesting about the fact when coding a Vue component you are not limited to use the code just inside it, you can reuse it outside or even reuse between components in a ES module-like style.

#### Better organization of tasks and todos
For the next "learn" projects I will describe all tasks and todos before even coding. If it is possible, I could even make documents about it.

### What I will consider not doing anymore?

#### Using TailwindCSS for large projects
It seems attractive in the start, but when the UI gets more complicated you get yourself again in the need for mastering a framework, not the usual HTML/CSS stuff.

#### Use cookies when not necessary
If I have a single application using this shared/commom user data, there is no need to use cookies.
